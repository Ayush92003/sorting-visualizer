# Sorting Visualizer
Welcome to the Sorting Visualizer project ! This interactive web app lets you visualize the process of sorting algorithms in action. Perfect for anyone who wants to learn about sorting algorithms through engaging and easy-to-follow visualizations.
# Features
Interactive Visualization: Watch the sorting process step by step.
Multiple Sorting Algorithms: Includes popular algorithms like:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

Customizable Controls: Adjust the array size and sorting speed to fit your preference.
Clean UI/UX: Minimalistic design for a smooth user experience using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
# Technologies Used
- HTML5 - Structure of the application
- CSS3 - Styling and creating a responsive design
- JavaScript - Logic and interactivity, including sorting algorithms and animations
- Bootstrap: Utilized for responsive button designs, making it easier to interact with the sorting controls.

# Learnings
This project was a great opportunity to dive deeper into:

- Understanding sorting algorithms and their performance.
- Improving my JavaScript skills for animation and DOM manipulation.
- Building an interactive web app with real-time feedback.
# Future Enhancements
- Add more advanced sorting algorithms (e.g., Heap Sort, Radix Sort).
- Improve animation speeds and styles for a smoother experience.
- Include algorithm explanations alongside the animations for better learning.
